# CS50 Python Project Bot - Rewritten for Discord
This is an attempt to rewrite my [Messenger Chatbot project](https://github.com/Rookie001MC/cs50_project/) for Discord.

## Why?
For something like a small project like this one, Facebook's app verification procedure feels very restrictive.
It took so much effort just to get something working out for everyone to use, and not only that, it also makes things difficult to update my apps (required to send app review every update).

Besides, coding for Discord actually is *really noice*, as at least you have your entire group of friends to test and use it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
